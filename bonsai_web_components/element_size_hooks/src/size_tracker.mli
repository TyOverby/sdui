(** When attached to a Vdom node, this attribute will monitor the size of this
    node, and report any changes to the size through the provided callback.

    If the callback changes, and is no longer [phys_equal] to itself, it will be
    called with the current size.

    Note: in almost all cases, you'll want to have box-sizing: border-box set
    on your node in order for it to measure the size of the element by looking
    at the border-size. *)
