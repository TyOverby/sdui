# `bonsai_web_ui_multi_select`

This library provides a widget for selecting multiple items from list.

It also provides `Multi_select_widget.Multi_factor`, which allows you
to have a bunch of such widgets indexed by some other type. A typical
use case might be a widget that allows the user to filter some table
by a number of different criteria.
