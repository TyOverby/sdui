        exactly once.

  (** ylabel http://dygraphs.com/options.html#ylabel

      Text to display to the left of the chart's y-axis. You can supply any HTML for
      this value, not just text. If you wish to style it using CSS, use the
      'dygraph-label' or 'dygraph-ylabel' classes. The text will be rotated 90 degrees
      by default, so CSS rules may behave in unintuitive ways. No additional space is
      set aside for a y-axis label. If you need more space, increase the width of the
      y-axis tick labels using the yAxisLabelWidth option. If you need a wider div for
      the y-axis label, either style it that way with CSS (but remember that it's
      rotated, so width is controlled by the 'height' property) or set the yLabelWidth
      option.

      Draw a small dot at each point, in addition to a line going through the

      Error bars (or custom bars) for each series are drawn in the same color as

      Use in conjunction with the "fractions" option. Instead of plotting +/- N

  -> ?rangeSelectorAlpha:float
  (** rangeSelectorAlpha http://dygraphs.com/options.html#rangeSelectorAlpha

      The transparency of the veil that is drawn over the unselected portions of
      the range selector mini plot. A value of 0 represents full transparency and
      the unselected portions of the mini plot will appear as normal. A value of 1
      represents full opacity and the unselected portions of the mini plot will be
      hidden.

      Default: black
  *)
  -> ?rangeSelectorHeight:int
  (** rangeSelectorHeight http://dygraphs.com/options.html#rangeSelectorHeight

  (** rangeSelectorPlotFillColor http://dygraphs.com/options.html#rangeSelectorPlotFillColor

      The range selector mini plot fill color. This can be of the form "#AABBCC" or

      fill.

      "yellow". You can also specify null or "" to disable the gradient and fill
      with one single color.

      Type: string
      Default: white
  *)

  (** rangeSelectorPlotLineWidth http://dygraphs.com/options.html#rangeSelectorPlotLineWidth

      Default: false
  *)
  -> ?series:Series.t
  (** series http://dygraphs.com/options.html#series

      Defines per-series options. Its keys match the y-axis label names, and the values
      are dictionaries themselves that contain options specific to that series.

      Type: Object
      Default: null
  *)
  -> ?digitsAfterDecimal:int
  (** digitsAfterDecimal http://dygraphs.com/options.html#digitsAfterDecimal

      Unless it's run in scientific mode (see the sigFigs option), dygraphs
      displays numbers with digitsAfterDecimal digits after the decimal
      point. Trailing zeros are not displayed, so with a value of 2 you'll
      get '0', '0.1', '0.12', '123.45' but not '123.456' (it will be
      rounded to '123.46'). Numbers with absolute value less than
      0.1^digitsAfterDecimal (i.e. those which would show up as '0.00')
      will be displayed in scientific notation.

      Type: integer
      Default: 2
  *)
  -> ?labelsKMB:bool
  (** labelsKMB http://dygraphs.com/options.html#labelsKMB

      Show K/M/B for thousands/millions/billions on y-axis.

      Default: false
  *)
  -> ?labelsKMG2:bool
  (** labelsKMG2 http://dygraphs.com/options.html#labelsKMG2

      Show k/M/G for kilo/Mega/Giga on y-axis. This is different than labelsKMB in
      that it uses base 2, not 10.

      Type: boolean
      Default: false
  *)
  -> ?labelsUTC:bool
  (** labelsUTC http://dygraphs.com/options.html#labelsUTC

      Show date/time labels according to UTC (instead of local time).

      Type: boolean
      Default: false
  *)
  -> ?maxNumberWidth:int
  (** maxNumberWidth http://dygraphs.com/options.html#maxNumberWidth

      When displaying numbers in normal (not scientific) mode, large numbers will
      be displayed with many trailing zeros (e.g. 100000000 instead of 1e9). This
      can lead to unwieldy y-axis labels. If there are more than maxNumberWidth
      digits to the left of the decimal in a number, dygraphs will switch to
      scientific notation, even when not operating in scientific mode. If you'd
      like to see all those digits, set this to something large, like 20 or 30.

      Type: integer
      Default: 6
  *)
  -> ?sigFigs:int
  (** sigFigs http://dygraphs.com/options.html#sigFigs

      By default, dygraphs displays numbers with a fixed number of digits after the
      decimal point. If you'd prefer to have a fixed number of significant figures,
      set this option to that number of sig figs. A value of 2, for instance, would
      cause 1 to be display as 1.0 and 1234 to be displayed as 1.23e+3.
