(** This is the default legend that [With_bonsai.create] will use if you don't pass
    [custom_legend].

    This is nicer than the default dygraph legend in that it's in a fixed location (to the
    right of the graph), allows toggling visibility, and underlines/bolds the highlighted
    series.  The look of this legend was largely copied from dwu's htmlplot dygraph
    legend. *)

    ; past_series_visibility : bool Map.M(String).t
    (** [past_series_visibility] remembers all the series (by [label_for_visibility]) that
        we've ever seen.  This means that if someone makes a change to a particular series
        (e.g. toggles visibility), moves to a graph without that series, and then moves
        back to the original graph, the information will not be lost.

        This may sound like a memory leak, and it kind of is, but the hope is that the
        total number of unique series labels that one sees over the lifetime of a graph is
        very small.  *)
