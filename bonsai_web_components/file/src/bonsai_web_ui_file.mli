(** An API that allows one to read files from the client's local disk.

    A value of [type t] can be created in two ways:

    1. Using the companion library [Bonsai_web_ui_file_from_web_file], which uses the
    Web File API to drive [t]. Note that the Web File API does not permit the reading of
    arbitrary files on the client computer's disk. Instead, one typically uses a file
    selector form to allow the user to specify a file to be read. See
    [Bonsai_web_ui_form.Elements.File_picker] for a convenient wrapper.

    2. For tests, one can also create a [t] which is driven manually using the
    [For_testing] module.
