# Navigation links

Navigation links (nav links for short) are links that go to another page in the same app.
They perform an on-page navigation (with `set_url`) if clicked directly, but also play
well with browser's support for Ctrl-clicking to open in a new tab, Shift-clicking to open
in a new window, and so on.

Navigation links can also wrap arbitrary elements, such as buttons.
